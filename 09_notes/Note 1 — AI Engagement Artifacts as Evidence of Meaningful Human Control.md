# note 1 — AI Engagement Artifacts as Evidence of Meaningful Human Control

## Purpose
Provide an operational, evidence-based definition of *meaningful human control* grounded in observable artifacts already produced in AI-mediated work.

---

## Core Claim
**Meaningful human control is not demonstrated by human presence, but by durable artifacts that show understanding, contestation, and redirection of AI behavior.**

If these artifacts exist, engagement exists.  
If they do not, control is nominal—even if approvals are logged.

---

## Evidence Basis
This note is grounded exclusively in the artifact ontology defined in the appendix of *The Journal of Prompt-Engineered Philosophy*.  
No new categories are introduced.

---

## Engagement Dimensions → Existing Artifact Types

### 1. Understanding (pre-action cognition)
**Artifact:** Epistemic Traces (Type 2)

**What they capture**
- Exploratory reasoning
- Sense-making prior to instruction stabilization
- Asynchronous influence on later outputs

**Why this matters**
Demonstrates that humans formed a working model of the system, rather than merely consuming outputs.

---

### 2. Contestation (epistemic friction)
**Artifacts**
- Epistemic Traces (Type 2)
- Prompt Development Logs (Type 8)

**What they capture**
- Alternatives considered and rejected
- Prompt iterations driven by uncertainty, dissatisfaction, or edge-case probing

**Why this matters**
Shows outputs were *challenged*, not passively accepted.

---

### 3. Redirection (control in action)
**Artifact:** Modification Logs (Type 7)

**What they capture**
- Concrete changes to outputs, prompts, or structure
- Explicit rationales for intervention

**Why this matters**
This is control in the strict sense: humans altered system behavior based on judgment.

---

### 4. Engagement that compounds over time
**Artifacts**
- Prompt Development Logs (Type 8)
- Pattern Summaries
- Section Summaries
- Reference / Continuity Logs

**What they capture**
- Persistence of learning across tasks
- Stabilization of successful constraints
- Reduction of repeated errors

**Why this matters**
Engagement is cumulative, not episodic.

---

## Operational Test for Meaningful Human Control
An organization can credibly claim meaningful human control **only if** it can produce:
- Epistemic Traces  
- Modification Logs with rationales  
- Prompt Development Logs showing evolution over time  

These are auditable engagement artifacts, not policy statements.

## Executive Use Cases
- AI risk assessment
- Governance evidence
- Internal audits
- Pre-incident control verification
