optimized use of artifacts:

derive the artifact description from C:\Users\loimi\switchdrive\CURRENTLY WORKING ON\AI - assisted papers\JPEP\Paper\UTILITY\Appendix3-5.md 

optimize for general usage in managerial control systems. Important:
1) assume full conversation recorded
2) epistemic trace value is synthesis
3) information value to be assessed retrospectively: cross check context of other epistemic traces to understand which information/idea are retained in process (can be updated re-scanning the source if needed at a later stage)
   
   NB: when writing metadata avoid all nesting (obsidian can't render those)
