# note 2 — Engagement Failures and the Artifact Lens (Post Framing)

## Opening Reframe
Most AI failures aren’t model failures.  
They’re failures of human engagement that leave no trace.

---

## Kill the Checkbox Myth
A human approving an AI output does not equal control.  
Control exists only if humans can understand, contest, and redirect the system—and that capacity leaves artifacts.

---

## The Pivot
**Engagement is not a mindset.  
It is an observable behavior that produces evidence.**

---

## Make It Concrete (Artifact Examples)
- Exploratory traces showing how people reasoned before acting  
- Logs showing *why* outputs were changed  
- Records showing how prompts evolved over time  

No artifacts → no engagement  
No engagement → no meaningful control

---

## Executive Translation
If an organization can’t point to these artifacts, it doesn’t have meaningful human control—only symbolic oversight.

---

## Closing Line
The real AI risk isn’t automation without humans.  
It’s automation without engagement evidence.
