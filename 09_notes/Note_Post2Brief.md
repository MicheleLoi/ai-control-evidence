# Post 2 Brief: Artifact Walkthrough

## Strategic Intent

Post 2 returns to the GitHub repo introduced in Post 1, providing a guided walkthrough of the artifact chain. It rewards Reader 2 (concrete tester) who clicked through and wants deeper understanding.

**Positioning:** "Here's what the artifacts actually show" — not self-promotion, but demonstration of the framework in action.

---

## Dependency: Post 1 Engagement Data

**[TO BE ADDED AFTER POST 1 GOES LIVE]**

- Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares)
- Comment themes / questions raised
- GitHub repo traffic (if trackable)
- Reader 2 signals (who clicked through, what they explored)

This data shapes Post 2 angle selection.

---

## GitHub Artifacts to Highlight

### Primary (most illustrative)

| Artifact | What it shows | Engagement dimension |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| 003_EpistemicTrace | Philosophy-to-executive translation crystallized | Understanding + Contestation |
| 004_EpistemicTrace | "Leaves traces" hinge sentence emerged | Redirection |
| PromptDevelopmentLog | How lost ideas were recovered (PDL-002, PDL-003) | Contestation + Compounding |
| Process Note | Full conversation chain mapped | Traceability |

### Secondary (if space allows)

| Artifact | What it shows |
|----------|---------------|
| Conversation chain | 4 conversations -> progressive refinement |
| Note 2 -> Complete Prompt | Starting skeleton -> final 9-beat structure |

---

## The "Lost and Recovered" Story

**Key narrative:** Ideas from early conversations got lost in compression. Epistemic traces preserved them. PDL documents their recovery.

**Specific example:**
- The three executive consequences (risk blind spots, governance theater, strategic fragility) were in the source conversation but missing from Note 2
- PDL-003 documents their recovery
- This IS the artifact evidence the framework describes

**Meta-move:** Post 2 demonstrates that the framework catches what would otherwise be lost.

## Candidate Angles (pick based on Post 1 response)

### Angle A: The Walkthrough
"What the artifact chain actually shows"
- Best if Reader 2 signals are strong (GitHub clicks)
- Straightforward tour of the repo

### Angle B: The Recovery Story
"What got lost and how we found it"
- Best if comments focus on "how do you actually do this?"
- Emphasizes PDL-002, PDL-003

### Angle C: The Hinge Sentence
"How one sentence changed the entire post"
- Best if engagement is high but shallow (people liked but didn't click)
- Focus on Trace 004, "if that capacity is real, it leaves traces"

### Angle D: Response to Objection
"Someone asked [X] — here's the evidence"
- Best if specific objection emerges in comments
- Use GitHub artifacts to answer directly

---

## Voice Continuity Notes

**From Post 1:**
- Declarative, sharp sentences
- Executive-native vocabulary
- Diagnostic expert tone
- No hedging, no self-congratulation

**Additions for Post 2:**
- Can be slightly more technical (Reader 2 opted in)
- Can reference specific files/artifacts by name
- Still matter-of-fact about the meta-demonstration

---

## Conversion to Complete Prompt

After Post 1 engagement data is collected:

1. Select angle based on response patterns
2. Specify which artifacts to highlight
3. Draft structure (likely 5-7 beats, shorter than Post 1)
4. Add voice requirements and forbidden elements
5. Output: CompletePrompt_Post2.md

## Timeline

- Post 1 goes live: [DATE TBD]
- Engagement observation period: 3-7 days
- Post 2 angle selection: After observation
- Post 2 draft: Via ChatGPT with this brief as input
