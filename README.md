# AI Control Evidence

This repository contains the complete artifact chain behind a LinkedIn post on meaningful human control in AI systems.

The post argued that engagement is not a mindset—it's an observable behavior that produces artifacts. This repo is the evidence.

## Artifact Types Demonstrated

This project shows what engagement evidence can look like. Each artifact type serves a different function:

### Conversations (raw transcripts)
`00_Conversations/`

Preserved AI interactions with metadata. Show the actual exchanges, including contestation, redirection, and the user's organic additions.

### Epistemic Traces
`01_epistemic_traces/`

Structured summaries of what each conversation produced. Capture understanding formed, key sentences that emerged, and how ideas transformed. Enable retrospective analysis without re-reading full transcripts.

### Prompt Development Log (PDL)
`03_prompt_development_log/`

Documents how a prompt evolved through iterations. Critical function: surfaces what got lost in compression and how it was recovered. PDL-002 and PDL-003 in this repo show content from early conversations that was compressed out of intermediate notes, then recovered via epistemic trace review.

### Complete Prompt
`02_complete_prompt/`

Final actionable specification with explicit source mapping. Shows exactly where each element came from in the chain.

### Process Note
`09_notes/Process Note - Artifact Chain Documentation.md`

Documents the full chain with verified text transfers and line numbers. The smoking gun evidence that the development process is reconstructible.

## Start Here

If you just landed from the LinkedIn post: start with the **Prompt Development Log**. PDL-002 and PDL-003 show the lost-and-recovered pattern—content that was compressed out of intermediate notes and recovered via epistemic trace review. Then look at **Epistemic Trace 004** to see where the hinge sentence ("if that capacity is real, it leaves traces") emerged. The **Process Note** ties it all together with line-by-line transfer evidence.

## The Chain

Four conversations → five epistemic traces → prompt development log → complete prompt → published post.

For the full diagram with transfer evidence, see the **Process Note**.

## Why This Exists

The LinkedIn post makes a claim: organizations can demonstrate meaningful human control through artifacts that show understanding, contestation, and redirection.

This repository demonstrates the claim by example. The post itself was built using the framework it describes.
