# Complete Prompt: LinkedIn Article on AI Documentation Traceability

## Task

Write a LinkedIn article explaining why traceability matters in AI-assisted intellectual work, using two concrete GitHub repositories as illustrations.

## Audience

- Primary: Professionals using AI for knowledge work who want to maintain intellectual ownership
- Secondary: Organizations developing AI governance policies
- Tertiary: Researchers interested in human-AI collaboration methodology

## Core Argument

AI-assisted work without documentation is a black box. You cannot verify what the human contributed, what the AI contributed, or whether the human genuinely engaged with the AI's output. Traceability solves this by creating auditable artifacts.

## Two Illustrative Patterns

The article demonstrates two different documentation workflows, each appropriate to different AI collaboration modes:

### Pattern 1: Pre-Prompt Documentation (ai-control-evidence repo)

**Workflow:** Human explores ideas through conversations → epistemic traces capture insights → prompt development log tracks how traces become instructions → complete prompt guides AI generation → output

**Key artifacts:**
- Epistemic Traces (Type 2): Exploratory dialogues that shaped the direction
- Prompt Development Log (Type 8): How scattered insights became structured guidance
- Complete Prompt (Type 1): The final specification

**What it shows:** The intellectual work happened *before* the AI generated the final output. The human's contribution is in framing, selecting, and structuring.

### Pattern 2: Post-Prompt Documentation (epistemic-commons-ai- repo)

**Workflow:** Human provides specification → AI drafts → human evaluates and redirects → modification log captures iterations → final output

**Key artifacts:**
- Complete Prompt (Type 1): Human-provided specification ("Key idea")
- Modification Log (Type 7): Iteration history with rationales for rejection/revision
- Conversation transcript: Full record of AI-human exchange

**What it shows:** The intellectual work happened *during and after* AI generation. The human's contribution is in evaluation, redirection, and quality control.

## Structure (7-8 beats)

1. **Opening hook:** The black box problem - AI-assisted work without traces
2. **The stakes:** Why this matters (verification, reproduction, intellectual ownership, governance)
3. **The solution framing:** Traceability through documentation artifacts
4. **Pattern 1 walkthrough:** Pre-prompt documentation (ai-control-evidence)
   - Brief description of the workflow
   - Key artifacts and what they show
   - Link to repo
5. **Pattern 2 walkthrough:** Post-prompt documentation (epistemic-commons-ai-)
   - Brief description of the workflow
   - Key artifacts and what they show
   - Link to repo
6. **The meta-point:** Different workflows need different documentation - but all need traceability
7. **Practical implications:** What this means for individuals and organizations
8. **Closing:** Invitation to explore the repos

## Voice Requirements

- Intellectual but accessible (not academic jargon)
- Concrete and specific (point to actual artifacts)
- Matter-of-fact about the methodology (not self-promotional)
- Diagnostic tone: revealing structure, not selling a solution

## Forbidden

- "Not because X, but because Y" construction (AI rhetorical tell)
- Vague recommendations ("document your process")
- Self-congratulation about the methodology
- Academic citation style (link to repos instead)
- Ethics framing (this is about practical verification, not virtue)

## Length

LinkedIn article format: 1500-2500 words. Longer than a post, but focused.

## Source Materials

- Note_Post2Brief.md (original brief, strategic intent)
- Both GitHub repositories (the illustrations themselves)
- Appendix3-5.md from JPEP project (the 11 document types framework)
