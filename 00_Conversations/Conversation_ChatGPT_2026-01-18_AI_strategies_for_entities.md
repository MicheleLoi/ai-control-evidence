Thought for 23s

## What AI strategies usually contain (and how mid-size vs large entities differ)

Most “AI strategies” (whether for companies, agencies, or other organizations) tend to be built from the same building blocks:

- **North Star & goals**: what AI is meant to achieve (growth, productivity, service quality, risk reduction).
    
- **Priority use cases**: a short list of where AI will be applied first, and why those use cases matter.
    
- **Data & platform foundations**: data quality, access, governance, security, tooling, and integration with existing systems.
    
- **Operating model & governance**: who decides what gets built, who owns models, how risk is managed (privacy, safety, bias), and how vendors are controlled.
    
- **Talent & ways of working**: needed roles (product, data/ML, engineering, legal/risk), training, and cross-functional delivery.
    
- **Responsible AI & compliance**: policies, model risk management, auditability, documentation, and lifecycle controls.
    
- **Delivery roadmap & investment**: sequencing (pilot → scale), funding approach, and “what happens in the next 6–24 months”.
    
- **KPIs & measurement**: how impact is tracked (cost, time saved, quality, user satisfaction, risk metrics).
    

**Typical differences by organization size**

**Mid-size entities (roughly: fewer layers, tighter budgets, smaller teams)**

- Focus on **a few high-ROI use cases** and faster time-to-value.
    
- Prefer **buy/partner** (SaaS + vendors) over building everything in-house.
    
- Lean governance: often a **small AI steering group** + practical policies.
    
- More emphasis on **data cleanup + process change** because they can’t “brute force” scaling with headcount.
    

**Large entities (complex orgs, many systems, higher scrutiny)**

- Build an **enterprise operating model**: AI center of excellence (CoE), federated teams, shared platforms.
    
- Heavy investment in **governance, security, audit, and compliance** (especially public sector/regulated industries).
    
- Bigger push for **standardization** (reference architectures, reusable components, model registries, MRM).
    
- Roadmaps often include **enterprise-wide scaling** and multiple domains at once (HR, finance, ops, customer, etc.).

## At least 6 online examples of AI strategies / roadmaps

Below are **8** concrete examples you can open online (mix of public sector and large organizations; these are among the clearest “strategy/roadmap” style documents that are publicly posted):

1. **Italy — “Italian Strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2024–2026” (AgID, 2024)**  
    A national-level strategy with priorities across public administration, research, education, and business. 
    
2. **Spain — “2024 Artificial Intelligence Strategy” (Government of Spain, 2024)**  
    A strategy-oriented dossier describing governance cadence and reporting, with an explicit annual status report mechanism. 
    
3. **European Court of Auditors — “Artificial Intelligence: initial strategy and deployment roadmap 2024–2025” (2024/2025)**  
    A clear example of an organization-level AI strategy + deployment roadmap, including risk considerations and concrete actions. 
    
4. **U.S. Department of Homeland Security — “Artificial Intelligence Roadmap 2024” (DHS, 2024)**  
    A department-wide roadmap that describes leadership roles and structured execution for AI adoption. 
    
5. **CISA — “2023–2024 CISA Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence” (U.S. Cybersecurity agency, 2023)**  
    A roadmap framing how the agency approaches AI, with actions and milestones across its mission areas. 
    
6. **Zambia — “National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2025–2027” (Government of Zambia, 2025)**  
    A national strategy document positioning AI for economic growth and public service improvement. 
    
7. **Nigeria — “National Artificial Intelligence Strategy” (NITDA/NCAIR, 2024)**  
    A national AI strategy describing how the country intends to harness AI for development and innovation. 
    
8. **African Union — “Continental Artificial Intelligence Strategy” (AU, July 2024)**  
    A continent-level strategy document setting direction and coordination themes for AI adoption and governance. 
    

If you want, I can also pull **6+ corporate (private-sector) examples** specifically (many firms don’t publish a single “AI strategy PDF,” but some publish strategy/roadmap-style playbooks, annual reports with AI strategy sections, or governance frameworks that function as an AI strategy).

##### You said:

I am only interested in corporate

###### ChatGPT said:

Thought for 24s

## What corporate AI strategies usually contain (and how mid-size vs large companies differ)

A corporate AI strategy is typically a **portfolio + operating model** for using AI safely and profitably. Most include:

- **Business intent**: the few measurable outcomes AI should drive (revenue, cost, speed, risk, CX).
    
- **Use-case portfolio & prioritization**: how the company picks “first” use cases (value, feasibility, risk) and when to scale them.
    
- **Data & platform plan**: what data is needed, how it’s governed, and what platforms/tools will power development and deployment.
    
- **Operating model**: who owns AI (central CoE vs federated teams), how products are delivered, and how vendors are used.
    
- **Risk, security & compliance**: privacy, cybersecurity, model risk management, documentation, and auditability.
    
- **Responsible AI (RAI) principles + controls**: fairness/bias, safety, transparency, human oversight, monitoring.
    
- **People & change**: training, new roles, adoption, and process redesign.
    
- **Metrics & lifecycle**: KPIs, model monitoring, incident response, and continuous improvement.
    

**Mid-size companies** tend to emphasize: a short list of high-ROI use cases, “buy/partner” tooling, lightweight governance, and fast adoption.  
**Large enterprises** tend to emphasize: enterprise-wide standards, deep governance/security, reusable platforms, and scaling across many business units with formal oversight.

Search information about me Michele Loi. Realistic as a human would do. Based on that profile, help me understand which roles involved in ai strategy execution must I target as a consultant

###### ChatGPT said:

Thought for 13s

I looked you up as a human would (Google your name, open the most “official-looking” hits, cross-check that they refer to the same person). There are **multiple people named Michele Loi**, so I focused on the profile that consistently matches **AI ethics / governance / fairness / transparency**, with affiliations that repeat across sources.

### What I found about “Michele Loi” (the AI ethics / governance profile)

- You present yourself publicly as **AI ethics & business consultancy** with a focus on transparency/trust and organizational preparedness for generative AI–driven shifts. 
    
- You’re listed as **Senior Scientific Advisor at AlgorithmWatch** and described as working on AI ethics/governance topics (fairness, transparency, trust, privacy/security). 
    
- You’re listed at the **University of Milan** as a contract professor for **“AI, Ethics and Law”** (A.Y. 2025/2026 shown). 
    
- Your Google Scholar profile aligns with a long-running research track in **AI ethics** (and adjacent political philosophy topics), with substantial citations. 
    

So, the “market signal” is pretty clear: **you are strongest where AI strategy execution touches governance, risk, compliance, and trust** (not generic “we should do AI” decks).

---

## Based on that profile: which roles you should target (for AI strategy execution)

When companies “execute AI strategy,” the real work happens in a few owners’ hands. With your positioning, you’ll win most often when you sell into roles that **own enterprise risk, control frameworks, and deployment gates**—and you partner with the engineering org rather than competing with it.

### 1) The owners of “Responsible AI / AI Governance” (your most direct buyers)

These are often the **budget holders or program owners** for exactly what you do.

- **Head of Responsible AI / Responsible AI Lead**
    
- **AI Governance Director / AI Policy & Governance Lead**
    
- **Director of Trustworthy AI / AI Risk & Controls**
    
- **Chief AI Officer / Head of AI (when governance sits there)**
    

Why they’ll buy: they need principles translated into **operational controls** (intake, risk tiering, documentation, human oversight, monitoring, incident response).

### 2) Risk & control functions that can _block_ deployments (high influence, frequent sponsors)

In many enterprises, these functions decide whether a model ships.

- **Chief Risk Officer (CRO)** / **Operational Risk**
    
- **Model Risk Management (MRM) Lead** (esp. banks/insurance)
    
- **Compliance Director** (esp. regulated sectors)
    
- **Internal Audit – Tech/Model Audit Lead**
    

How you fit: you help them convert “ethics” into **auditable artifacts** and **stage gates** that don’t kill delivery velocity.

### 3) Legal / privacy / regulatory roles (especially in the EU)

Given your “ethics + law” footprint, these can be your fastest path into enterprise-wide programs.

- **General Counsel** (or **Head of Tech/Product Counsel**)
    
- **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** / **Privacy Counsel**
    
- **Regulatory Affairs / Public Policy Lead** (AI & digital regulation)
    
- **Product Governance / Policy** (platform companies)
    

Your wedge: “We can meet obligations and reduce enforcement risk _without_ freezing innovation.”

### 4) Security & technology risk roles (where “unsafe AI” becomes a security issue)

Generative AI has made this space explode.

- **CISO / Head of Security Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)**
    
- **Third-Party/Vendor Risk Lead** (for model providers + AI SaaS)
    
- **Security Architecture / Secure AI Lead**
    

What they need from you: threat-informed **controls for AI misuse**, data leakage, prompt injection, model supply-chain risk, and secure operating procedures.

### 5) CIO / CTO org roles that run the AI platform and need a governance layer

These are key partners because they operationalize what you design.

- **CIO / CTO**
    
- **Head of Data & Analytics / CDO org**
    
- **Head of ML Platform / MLOps**
    
- **Enterprise Architecture Lead**
    

Best angle: you **co-design the operating model** (federated vs CoE), embed governance into tooling (registries, evals, approvals), and keep it pragmatic.

### 6) Business “transformation” owners who need adoption at scale

These roles care about measurable outcomes and change management.

- **Chief Transformation Officer**
    
- **Process Excellence / Continuous Improvement lead**
    
- **Business Unit COO / Ops Excellence**
    

How you sell: “We’ll pick high-risk/high-impact workflows and make them deployable responsibly—then scale.”

---

## The “must-target” short list (if you want the highest hit rate)

If you’re choosing where to spend your time, prioritize:

1. **Head of Responsible AI / AI Governance**
    
2. **CRO / Operational Risk** or **MRM Lead** (sector-dependent)
    
3. **Product/Tech Legal + DPO (privacy)**
    
4. **CISO / Security GRC**
    
5. **CDO/Head of Data & Analytics** (for implementation partnership)
    

---

## How to position your consulting offer so these roles say yes

Given your public profile (ethics, transparency, trust, governance), the cleanest packaging is:

- **“AI Governance that ships”**: design the controls + integrate into delivery (intake, risk tiering, evals, documentation, approvals, monitoring).
    
- **“GenAI systemic risk & trust program”**: focus on collapsed trust signals, provenance, policy, comms, and operational mitigations (very aligned with your website framing). 
    
- **“Reg-ready AI operating model”**: map obligations → controls → evidence packs; train teams; stand up the steering + RACI.
    

---

If you tell me **your target industries** (e.g., finance, pharma, platform tech, manufacturing) and whether you want **hands-on implementation** or mostly **advisory**, I’ll rank the roles above by deal size / sales cycle / likelihood and suggest an outreach narrative for each.

##### You said:

Examine the degree of overlap. Successful professionals in these role know , or at least think they know, as much or more than I do about the classical bias , control problems, at the level of detail that matters for their orgs

###### ChatGPT said:

You’re right to be skeptical: in many mature orgs, the people in **Responsible AI / AI governance / MRM / privacy / security GRC** roles already know the _classical_ bias-and-controls playbook (or believe they do), at exactly the level that “passes” internally.

So your edge can’t be “I know bias exists” or “here are fairness metrics.” The overlap is real. The trick is to understand **where their knowledge is deep but local**, and where you can be **deeper, broader, or more execution-oriented** than what they have time/incentives to do.

## Where the overlap is highest

### 1) Responsible AI / AI Governance leads

**They usually know**: common bias types, fairness metrics (at least top-level), documentation patterns (model cards, datasheets), governance structures, review boards, “human in the loop,” monitoring slogans, and the main regulatory/compliance vocabulary.

**Where it breaks down** isn’t “awareness,” it’s:

- translating principles into **enforceable gates** that don’t get bypassed
    
- defining **what evidence is enough** per risk tier
    
- making controls fit **GenAI + vendor models** (where you don’t control training data)
    
- resolving tradeoffs (privacy vs explainability, fairness vs calibration, safety vs usability) _in product terms_
    

### 2) Model Risk Management / Operational Risk (esp. finance)

**They often know**: control frameworks, validation, independent review, documentation, monitoring, inventory, change management.

Their blind spot is not controls—it’s that traditional MRM patterns can be **misapplied** to:

- LLMs / retrieval systems / agentic workflows
    
- continuously changing systems (prompt + tool + data drift)
    
- “model” boundaries (is it the foundation model, RAG pipeline, prompt policy, tool stack?)
    

They may over-index on legacy templates and miss what’s actually “model risk” in modern stacks.

### 3) Privacy / Legal / Compliance

**They know**: GDPR basics, lawful bases, DPIAs, vendor clauses, records of processing, retention, DPA obligations.

The gap is often:

- how to structure **AI-specific DPIA/AI impact assessments** that meaningfully connect to product architecture
    
- how to operationalize **data minimization** with RAG, telemetry, feedback loops, and fine-tuning
    
- contract + governance for **foundation model supply chain** (subprocessors, model updates, audit rights, eval obligations)
    

### 4) Security / GRC / CISO org

**They know**: threat modeling, secure SDLC, third-party risk, monitoring, incident response.

The gap is:

- secure-by-design practices for **prompt injection, tool misuse, data exfiltration, jailbreaks**
    
- how to integrate “AI red teaming” into release cycles without it becoming theatre
    
- controls that work when “users” are internal employees pushing the system to do disallowed things
    

## The key insight: their “as much as you” is _organizationally bounded_

Most of these professionals are **domain owners** inside a specific org. They know:

- the internal systems, politics, and constraints
    
- the minimum viable evidence required to ship
    
- what the regulator/auditor historically cared about
    

You can win by being:

- **cross-industry comparative** (“what peers are doing that actually works”)
    
- **mechanism-level** (not just naming controls, but specifying testable requirements)
    
- **implementation-adjacent** (controls embedded into workflows and tooling)
    
- **independent** (credible reviewer, not captured by delivery incentives)
    

## Where you can still have a strong advantage

### A) Turning “controls” into **decision procedures**

Many orgs have lists of controls. Few have crisp answers to:

- “What’s the risk tier of _this_ GenAI feature?”
    
- “What evidence must exist before launch?”
    
- “Who signs off, and what happens if they don’t?”
    
- “What is the stop-ship threshold?”
    

If you can provide **a lightweight but enforceable rubric** (risk tiering + evidence checklist + escalation + sign-off rules), you’re immediately useful even to experts.

### B) GenAI-specific failure modes and evaluation design

Classical bias frameworks don’t cover enough of:

- instruction hierarchy + tool calling risks
    
- non-determinism, prompt sensitivity, hidden policy conflicts
    
- retrieval poisoning, prompt injection, leakage via citations
    
- “capability overhang” (system becomes more powerful than governance assumptions)
    

If you can define **evaluation suites** that map to business harms (not just benchmark scores) and show how to operationalize them (pre-release + monitoring), you’ll outflank “we already know bias.”

### C) “Governance that scales” through product/engineering mechanics

Even sophisticated governance teams struggle to embed controls into:

- CI/CD gates
    
- model registries / inventory
    
- incident management
    
- vendor update processes
    
- audit evidence generation
    

If you can help them wire governance into the **actual SDLC/MLOps**, you’re not competing on knowledge—you’re competing on _making it real_.

### D) Handling tradeoffs with executive clarity

People may “know” bias/controls, but still fail at:

- making uncomfortable tradeoffs explicit
    
- setting acceptable risk thresholds
    
- aligning Legal/Risk/Security/Product on one decision
    

A consultant who can facilitate that alignment and produce a **decision record** that survives audit/regret is valuable.

## Role-by-role: what you should assume they already “have,” and what you should sell

- **Responsible AI Lead**  
    Assume: principles + basic governance exists.  
    Sell: risk tiering + evidence standards + GenAI evals + workflow integration + board effectiveness.
    
- **MRM / Risk**  
    Assume: templates + validation muscle.  
    Sell: modern system boundary definitions, GenAI validation patterns, continuous change governance, vendor-model validation, monitoring triggers.
    
- **Legal/DPO**  
    Assume: GDPR competence.  
    Sell: AI impact assessment that ties to architecture; foundation model contracting playbooks; RAG/fine-tune data governance; explainability + transparency communications that are defensible.
    
- **CISO/GRC**  
    Assume: strong security processes.  
    Sell: AI-specific threat models + red-team playbooks + secure prompt/tooling patterns + policy enforcement & logging strategies.
    

## Practical positioning: stop leading with “bias,” lead with “execution artifacts”

If they think they know as much as you about classical bias, your pitch should center on deliverables like:

- **AI system risk tiering framework** (with clear gates)
    
- **Evidence pack template** that engineering can produce automatically
    
- **GenAI evaluation + monitoring plan** tied to real harms
    
- **Vendor foundation model governance** (update management + assurance)
    
- **Incident playbook** for AI harms (security + legal + comms)
    
- **Operating model**: who owns what, escalation, audit trail
    

Those are hard even for experts—because they’re messy, cross-functional, and require decisions.

If you want, tell me which side you prefer to play:

1. **Builder** (design + embed controls into delivery), or
    
2. **Independent assurance** (review, gap analysis, board-ready signoff), or
    
3. **Facilitator** (align leadership and define risk appetite).
    

I’ll map that to the best target roles and the tightest “why you” narrative that doesn’t rely on claiming superior bias knowledge.

##### You said:

The choice of role is hard for me. I love designing things. I've built Impact Assessment schemes 2 of them with significant testing. I've built artifacts to track text ai usage and influence on decision. I'm running evals with petri and I built targeted feeds. But I fear I don't have enough credentials to sell that.

###### ChatGPT said:

What you’re describing is a **very common but under-articulated tension** for people like you: you are already operating at the _builder / designer_ level of AI governance, but the market still tries to classify you as “ethics / advisory.” The fear about credentials is understandable—but it’s also slightly misframed.

Let me break this down carefully and concretely.

---

## 1. First, a reality check: what you’re already doing is _rare_

Most people in “Responsible AI” roles:

- **have not built** impact assessment schemes end-to-end
    
- **have not tested them empirically**
    
- **have not instrumented real systems** to track AI influence on decisions
    
- **have not run systematic evals** (let alone with Petri nets or formal workflow models)
    
- **have not designed targeted information feeds as controls**
    

What you list is not “ethics theory.” It is **governance engineering**.

That matters, because **buyers don’t actually care about credentials in the abstract**—they care about whether you can reduce uncertainty and execution risk in _their_ system.

---

## 2. Why it _feels_ like you lack credentials (and why that’s misleading)

### The credential mismatch problem

You’re comparing yourself against three misleading benchmarks:

1. **Academic authority** (tenure, famous labs)
    
2. **Big-brand consulting authority** (“ex-McKinsey AI lead”)
    
3. **Internal authority** (“I own this system, therefore I’m legitimate”)
    

You don’t fully match (2), and you don’t want (1). But (3) is _exactly_ what you simulate as a consultant by delivering artifacts that become part of the system.

In AI governance, **artifacts create authority**.

---

## 3. The key shift: stop selling _yourself_, sell **design objects**

Right now, your fear is:

> “I don’t have enough credentials to sell _me_ as the designer.”

The solution is:

> **Don’t sell yourself. Sell the things you design.**

### What this looks like in practice

Instead of:

- “I help you design AI impact assessments”
    

You say:

- “We deploy an AI Impact Assessment system with tested risk tiering, evidence requirements, and review workflows, and adapt it to your stack in 6–8 weeks.”
    

You move from **expert authority** to **product authority**.

---

## 4. Reframe your role: you are not a “Responsible AI advisor”

The role that actually fits you is something like:

> **AI Governance Architect / AI Risk Systems Designer**

This is crucial:  
**Architects are expected to design even if they’re not famous.**

They’re evaluated on:

- soundness of structure
    
- fit to constraints
    
- testability
    
- reusability
    
- failure handling
    

Not on moral authority.

---

## 5. Let’s map your concrete work to _sellable system components_

### A) Impact Assessment schemes (2 built + tested)

This is **very strong**, but only if framed correctly.

What buyers care about:

- Is it **risk-tiered**?
    
- Does it map to **deployment gates**?
    
- Can it be **reused across teams**?
    
- Does it produce **audit evidence**?
    
- Does it adapt to **GenAI + vendor models**?
    

You should package this as:

> “A modular AI Impact Assessment system with decision thresholds, escalation paths, and evidence outputs—already field-tested.”

### B) Artifacts to track text AI usage & influence on decisions

This is extremely rare and extremely valuable.

Most orgs **do not know**:

- when AI materially influenced a human decision
    
- how to prove “human oversight” wasn’t fake
    
- how to distinguish “assistive” vs “decisional” AI use
    

You are sitting on something close to a **killer differentiator**.

This is not “ethics.”  
This is **control instrumentation**.

### C) Evals with Petri nets

This puts you in a different class entirely.

Almost nobody in corporate Responsible AI:

- formally models workflows
    
- tests control propagation
    
- reasons about concurrency, escalation, or deadlocks
    

This is **governance correctness**, not philosophy.

### D) Targeted feeds

That’s **behavioral control design**: shaping what decision-makers see, when, and why.

Again: execution, not theory.

---

## 6. Why credentials matter less _for designers_ than for reviewers

Here’s an important distinction:

|Role|Credentials matter?|Why|
|---|---|---|
|Independent reviewer / auditor|High|Authority, defensibility|
|Policy author|Medium|Legitimacy|
|Governance designer / architect|**Low–Medium**|Artifacts speak|
|Tooling / system designer|**Low**|Working system > resume|

If you wanted to sell **sign-off authority**, credentials would matter a lot more.

You want to sell **design and implementation**.

---

## 7. The safest role choice for you (given your fear)

Given:

- you love designing
    
- you already build real systems
    
- you’re uneasy about pure advisory legitimacy
    

The **least risky** positioning is:

> **“I design and implement AI governance systems, but you own the decisions.”**

This does three things:

1. Removes the need for moral or regulatory authority
    
2. Keeps you close to concrete design work
    
3. Makes internal leaders comfortable (they retain sign-off)
    

---

## 8. How to make your credentials “felt” without overselling them

### A) Show, don’t claim

You should have:

- redacted diagrams
    
- example impact assessment flows
    
- sample risk-tier matrices
    
- mock evaluation reports
    
- anonymized monitoring dashboards
    

Even partial visuals dramatically raise perceived credibility.

### B) Use _comparative authority_

Say things like:

- “This pattern emerged across multiple assessment systems I’ve built.”
    
- “We tested three variants; this one failed under X conditions.”
    
- “Most orgs stop here; this is where controls actually break.”
    

This positions you as someone who has **seen systems fail**, which executives respect.

### C) Borrow legitimacy strategically

You already have:

- AlgorithmWatch
    
- academic teaching
    
- published research
    

You don’t need more credentials—you need to **attach them explicitly** to your system-building work.

---

## 9. A concrete recommendation

**Primary role to target:**  
👉 _AI Governance Architect / Builder (hands-on, system design + implementation)_

**Secondary role to tolerate (but not lead with):**  
👉 Strategic advisor on Responsible AI / GenAI risk

**Role to avoid leading with (for now):**  
❌ Independent ethical authority / reviewer

If you want, next we can:

- turn your existing work into **2–3 named “systems”** (with crisp descriptions)
    
- craft a **one-page positioning** that makes your design authority obvious
    
- rehearse how to answer: _“Why should we trust you to design this?”_ without leaning on credentials
    

Just tell me which you want to do first.
